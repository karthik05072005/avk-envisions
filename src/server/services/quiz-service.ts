 * Quizzes.
 *
 * A quiz is an ordinary `Test` with category QUIZ, gathered under one series.
 * Modelling it that way means the attempt engine, the admin editor, the PDF
 * import and the result page all work on it unchanged — the only new things
 * are the two pages that list them.
 *
 * The category is also what keeps the two pools apart. Practice draws from the
 * whole published bank, so without a boundary a quiz question would surface
 * inside a mock test; a quiz question is attached only to quiz tests, and
 * `quizQuestionIds()` is what the practice pool excludes.
