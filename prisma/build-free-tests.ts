/**
 * Fills the free tests with real questions.
 *
 * Ten free tests were published carrying nothing. A student picking one out of
 * the catalogue committed to sitting it and arrived at an empty paper — the
 * single most damaging thing the site was doing, because it happened at the
 * moment someone decided to trust it.
 *
 * These are built from questions already in the bank rather than invented:
 * every one is a real KAS previous-year question with a verified key. The mix
 * follows the weighting of the actual paper, so a free test is a fair sample of
 * what the paid series contains rather than whatever happened to be to hand.
 *
 * Tests that cannot be filled are left as DRAFT, not published empty.
 *
 *   npm run db:free-tests -- --dry-run
 *
 * Run with: npm run db:free-tests
