/**
 * Rebuilds the subject papers that held the wrong questions.
 *
 * Two faults produced six wrong papers, and neither was a bad upload:
 *
 *   seed-catalogue attached every question coded "KAS-PYQ-2024" to the
 *   December Polity drill — 191 August plus 195 December questions from both
 *   full-length papers — so it advertised 372 and was mostly not Polity. That
 *   ran on every deploy, so clearing it in the admin never held.
 *
 *   Separately, all 391 of those questions carry subjectId "Indian Polity"
 *   whatever they are about, because the analysis PDFs they came from have no
 *   subject headings for the classifier to read. That is why the five August
 *   subject drills held one question each: only the handful of stragglers
 *   landed anywhere near the right place.
 *
 * The fix is to fill each subject drill from its own subject PDF, which is the
 * only document that actually states which questions belong to that subject.
 *
 * Questions are DETACHED from a drill, never deleted. A drill is a cut of the
 * full-length paper, so a question leaving the drill must stay on the paper a
 * student sits.
 *
 *   npx tsx prisma/rebuild-subject-papers.ts --dry-run
 *
 * Safe to re-run: questions are keyed on a deterministic code, so a second run
 * refreshes them rather than duplicating.
