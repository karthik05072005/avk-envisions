/**
 * Puts the published KAS 50 Days timetable onto the day papers.
 *
 * The papers were laid out by seed-50-days.ts as "Day N — 50 Questions" on
 * consecutive dates from whenever it was run. The real schedule has a fixed
 * start, a subject and key focus per day, and a paper number — all of which
 * the /50-days page already renders but nothing was setting.
 *
 * Only the timetable is touched: dates, titles, subject, paper number and the
 * briefing text. Questions already attached are left exactly as they are, so
 * this is safe to re-run after content has been written.
 *
 *   npx tsx prisma/apply-50-days-schedule.ts --dry-run
 *
 * Run with: npx tsx prisma/apply-50-days-schedule.ts
